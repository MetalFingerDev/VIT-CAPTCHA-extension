## üåê Environment Configuration

The server's behavior is controlled by environment variables. You can set these in a `.env` file in the root directory.

| Variable         | Description                                      | Example                                           |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|

## üó∫ Roadmap

### ‚úÖ Short-term Goals

- Implement a proper testing framework (`pytest`) for the backend API  
- Refactor the extension to use a secure messaging channel between `content.js` and `background.js`  
- Containerize the backend using Docker  
- Fine-tune the TrOCR model on a custom dataset of VIT CAPTCHAs  

### ‚òëÔ∏è Mid-term Goals

- Migrate from Flask's development server to Gunicorn  
- Add support for Firefox and Edge via WebExtension API  
- Implement structured logging for API and model performance  

### ‚úîÔ∏è Long-term Goals

- Develop algorithms for distorted/animated CAPTCHAs  
- Build a dashboard to monitor and manage extension behavior  
- Explore a plugin ecosystem for community CAPTCHA contributions
